- Recursive CTEs for product category hierarchy analysis
- Text length and pattern analysis for review quality
- Time-series sentiment forecasting


### 3. üï∏Ô∏è **Competitive Network Analysis**
**Business Problem**: How do sellers compete and influence each other in the marketplace?

**Advanced Techniques**:
- Graph neural network simulation through complex SQL joins
- Multi-dimensional competitive relationship mapping
- Shared customer analysis for market overlap
- Network centrality scoring for influence measurement


### 4. üåê **Recursive Influence Networks**
**Business Problem**: How do customers influence each other through geographic and social connections?

**Advanced Techniques**:
- Recursive CTEs for influence propagation modeling
- Geographic proximity-based network effects
- Multi-touch attribution modeling
- Influence decay algorithms


### 5. üéØ **Behavioral Pattern Recognition for Fraud Detection**
**Business Problem**: How can we identify fraudulent behavior before transactions complete?

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **MySQL 8.0+** installed and running
- **MySQL Workbench** for query execution
- **Python 3.7+** (for data preprocessing)
- **8GB+ RAM** recommended for full dataset

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone/Download the project**
   ```bash
   git clone [gh repo clone thekhushimalik/Portfolio/]
   cd Sql_ecom_project
   ```

2. **Download the Olist dataset**
   - Go to [Kaggle Olist Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce)
   - Download and extract to `archive/` folder

3. **Create optimized dataset** (optional, for faster testing)
   ```bash
   python scripts/create_small_dataset.py
   ```

4. **Set up MySQL database**
   ```sql
   -- In MySQL Workbench
   SOURCE database_setup/create_tables.sql;
   -- Then import CSV files using Table Data Import Wizard
   ```

5. **Run the advanced analyses**
   ```sql
   -- Execute each operation in sequence
   SOURCE sql_queries/01_window_functions_behavioral.sql;
   SOURCE sql_queries/02_nlp_text_analytics.sql;
   -- ... continue with remaining operations
   ```
